# Hygge

In this time, where there no definite boundaries between working hours and resting hours. It is to take some time out for mindfulness.
Presenting Hygge, it goes by its name of providing a warm, pleasent and comfortable atmosphere, void of annoyance and distraction, 
where you can be at total ease. It is described as something we ‘want all the time- but seldom have’.
